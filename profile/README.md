:wave: Welcome to the official GitHub presence of IronCore. We are part of [ApeiroRA](https://apeirora.eu/content/projects/) which is an Important Project of Common European Interest - Next Generation Cloud Infrastructures and Services (IPCEI-CIS). Project IronCore is an open source system for managing compute and storage workloads across multiple providers.

## :globe_with_meridians: ApeiroRA?

ApeiroRA is a reference blueprint for an open, flexible, secure, and compliant next-generation cloud-edge continuum and therefore a key contribution to IPCEI-CIS. At a high level, the projects of ApeiroRA allow users to provider-agnostically fetch, request and consume services, and for service providers to describe, offer and provision their services.

Learn more about ApeiroRA by checking out the official website at [https://apeirora.eu/](https://apeirora.eu/).

## :handshake: IronCore

IronCore provides a reference for compounded software layers for inventorying, managing, and maintaining baremetal using Kubernetesâ€™ cloud-native principles. IronCore can be used for cloud-native workloads via Gardener directly, where IronCore dynamically sources ephemeral virtual and physical machines for Kubernetes.

## :penguin: Features

- **Single Interface:** Single Interface for managing resources orchestrated across regions, data centers, and availability zones.
- **Vendor-Neutral Storage Backend:** Ceph is modularly provided as a cloud-natively automated, vendor-neutral storage backend for block, shared, and object storage.
- **CLOS Network Fabric:** Network fabric based on CLOS Topology is included.
